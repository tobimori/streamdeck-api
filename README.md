  Serverless Stream Deck Store API & custom Shields.io & Badgen endpoint powered by Next.js & Vercel
</p>

## Schema
All API access happens over HTTPS, using GET requests and is accessed from `https://streamdeck.api.moeritz.io/api/`, that means that a usual call is a GET request to an url that may looks like `https://streamdeck.api.moeritz.io/api/json/downloads/author/tobimori` or similar urls. All content is served as JSON and cached server-side for an hour.

## JSON
All API endpoints are available as a json version with full functionality.

```
https://streamdeck.api.moeritz.io/api/json/...
```

## Shields.io
All API endpoints are also available as [Shields.io](https://shields.io/) custom endpoint.

```
https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://streamdeck.api.moeritz.io/api/shields/...&style=...
```

An example url therefore would look like this:
```
https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://streamdeck.api.moeritz.io/api/shields/downloads/com.elgato.counter
```

Which outputs:

![](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://streamdeck.api.moeritz.io/api/shields/downloads/com.elgato.counter)

## Badgen
All API endpoints are also available as [Badgen](https://badgen.net/) custom endpoint.

```
https://badgen.net/https/streamdeck.api.moeritz.io/api/badgen/...
```

An example url therefore would look like this:
```
https://badgen.net/https/streamdeck.api.moeritz.io/api/badgen/downloads/com.elgato.counter
```

Which outputs:

![](https://badgen.net/https/streamdeck.api.moeritz.io/api/badgen/downloads/com.elgato.counter)
